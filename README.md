### Project Title:
Predicting Hospital Readmission for Diabetes Patients
### Description:
Using a dataset submitted to UCI from Virginia Commonwealth University detailing 10 years of clinical care at U.S. hospitals and integrated delivery networks, I'll analyze the inpatient encounters for diabetes patients to determine the features related to readmission and try to predict whether a patient will be readmitted.
### Features and Target Variables:
* HbA1c Test Result
* Diagnosis
* Number of Hospital Visits in the Year Prior
* Number of Medications
* Race
* Gender
* Age
* Admission Type
* Length of Hospital Stay
### Data Used (e.g., NYC Open Data):
[UCI Diabetes 130-US Hospitals for Years 1999-2008](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Diabetes+130-US+hospitals+for+years+1999-2008)
### Tools Used (e.g., Scrapy, Seaborn, etc.):
* PostgreSQL
* Seaborn
* Pandas
### Possible Impacts:
Health outcomes for diabetic patients can be improved and healthcare costs for treatment can be lowered.
